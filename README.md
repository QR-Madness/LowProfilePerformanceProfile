# System Metrics Monitor

A lightweight system monitoring tool that displays CPU, Memory, and Disk usage in your MS Windows system tray.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of system resources
- Minimal resource footprint
- Easy-to-read visual indicators
- Hover tooltips with exact values
- Clean system tray integration

## Usage

Simply run the executable and look for the icon in your system tray. Hover over the icon to see exact usage values.

To exit, right-click the icon and select "Exit."

### CMD-Based Startup Trick

L3P is low-profile and will never install itself, thus to be able to quick-launch the app, add the built executable
to your home folder.

## System Requirements

- Windows 7 or later ([see: 'Why Only Windows?' below](#why-only-windows))
- No installation requiredâ€”just run the executable

### Why only Windows?

Linux has so many incredibly useful tools for monitoring system performance (e.g. bashtop, widgets, and KDE
have lots of cool performance gadgets too).

Additionally, no Mac implementation exists as I'm unfamiliar with the widget ecosystem.
